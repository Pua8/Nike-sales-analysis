# Nike sales analysis
In this assignment, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand customer satisfaction using a dataset that included variables such as arrival days, customer feedback, age, gender, free gifts, and discounts. Our work involved several key steps:

Data Collection and Cleaning: We began by identifying and transforming relevant variables, such as converting categorical data into numerical form and dropping unnecessary columns. We addressed missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers, ensuring the dataset was suitable for analysis.

Hypothesis Testing: We performed a series of hypothesis tests using ANOVA, T-tests, and regression analysis to explore relationships between different variables and customer satisfaction. Key findings include:

A significant difference in customer satisfaction based on feedback types and the presence of free gifts or discounts.
A positive impact of fast arrival and the provision of free gifts on customer satisfaction, especially when arrival days are high.
No significant relationship was found between customer age or gender and satisfaction.
Descriptive Analysis and Visualization: We conducted descriptive statistics and visualizations, including heatmaps and scatter plots, to summarize the data and illustrate key relationships. This provided a clear picture of how different factors influence customer satisfaction.

Recommendations: Based on our findings, we suggested strategies to improve customer satisfaction, such as enhancing delivery speed, offering more discounts, and implementing free gift programs.
